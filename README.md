I've built this site as a project for Core Code School. There are a lot of empty "pueblos" in Spain, and a lot of people who would like to fill them.

## **About Pueblar**

---

In Spain, there are a lot of empty homes in small towns in rural areas. Most of these towns have all the amenities (good communications, stores, bars, schools..). Meanwhile in the cities life is really expensiv, so there is a lot of untapped potential in these houses.

<br/>
<br/>

## **Motivation**

---

I've built the game as a project for Core Code School. Backend with mongodb and frontend in typescript.

## **Thanks**

I would like to thank our teacher [Juan Pablo Mora Serrano](https://github.com/Systrent) and [Core Code School](https://www.corecode.school/r), for all the help provided during these classes weeks and for being available to answer any questions. Nor would it have been possible without the support of my colleagues Junior and Daniel.
